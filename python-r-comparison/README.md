# Python R Comparison

Notes on the differences between programming in R and Python

## Basic Building Blocks

###R
```R
> 5 + 7
[1] 12
```
###Python
```Python
>>> 5 + 7
12
```

###R
```R
> x <- 5 + 7
> x
[1] 12
```
###Python
```Python
>>> x = 5 + 7
>>> x
12
```
###R - Assignment to a vector
```R
z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
```
###Python Assignment to a vector
```Python
>>> z = [1.1, 9, 3.14]
```

###R - Find help "Combine Values into a Vector or List"
```R
> ?c
```

###Python - Find help "Combine Values into a Vector or List"
```Python
>>> help("list")
```
